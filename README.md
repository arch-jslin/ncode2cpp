A school work I did in Jan, 2006. 

Using a direct port from Actionscript1/2 to C++, from the code here:
http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialA.html
http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialB.html

And slap it onto Qt Framework back then (I think Qt 4.0 just came out that year, 
so I guarantee you this code won't work anymore now.) 

And I turn the tile map into an unfinished break-out (hit the brick) game.

After all these years, I met Mare at GDC 2013,
so I dug this up and decided to push this to github,

It meant a lot to me. :)
